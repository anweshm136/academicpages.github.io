1. **SincNet for Small Footprint Keyword Spotting** (Summer '20)  
    _Advisor: Prof.Oliver Bringmann, University of Tuebingenn, Germany_  
    Implemented SincNet in the University's framework using PyTorch. Increased the efficiency for the [original SincNet model for KWS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337075024_Small-Footprint_Keyword_Spotting_on_Raw_Audio_Data_with_Sinc-Convolutions "original") by reducing the model size as well as computations without compromising on accuracy. Conducted an extensive benchmark test under several noise conditions, where the proposed model outperformed the state-of-art TC-RESNET 8 model.

2. **Eigen Faces vs Fisher Faces** (Spring '19)  
    _Advisor: Prof.Suyash Awate, CS, IITB_  
    Implemented and compared two popular face recognition algorithms, fisher faces and eigen faces. Analyzed the differences in performances of the algorithms on the [Yale Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/yale-face-database "Dataset") which has sufficient variations in lighting and facial expressions, and provided a mathematical basis for this difference in performance as well.

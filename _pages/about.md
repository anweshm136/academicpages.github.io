I am currently a fourth year Undergraduate student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay. My research interests lie broadly in the area of **machine learning** and **AI**, **computer vision** and **signal processing**.

This is a work under progress and I will try to be regular in keeping this as much updated as possible.

1. **SincNet for Small Footprint Keyword Spotting** (Summer 20')\
   _Advisor: Prof.Oliver Bringmann, University of Tuebingenn, Germany_\
   Implemented SincNet in the University's framework using PyTorch. Increased the efficiency for the [original SincNet model for KWS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337075024_Small-Footprint_Keyword_Spotting_on_Raw_Audio_Data_with_Sinc-Convolutions "original") by reducing the model size as well as computations without compromising on accuracy. Conducted an extensive benchmark test under several noise conditions, where the proposed model outperformed the state-of-art TC-RESNET 8 model.
